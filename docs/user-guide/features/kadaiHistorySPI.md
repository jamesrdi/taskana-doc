# KadaiHistory SPI

In order to follow this article, please read [general SPI information](howToUseServiceProviderInterfaces.md) before proceeding.

The KadaiHistory can be used for different purposes. In general, it tracks actions performed by KADAI, like creation of Workbaskets, completion of Tasks etc.. The HistoryService makes this information available for further usage. KADAI already provides an implementation for the KadaiHistory described [here](#kadaihistory-implementation-and-the-corresponding-rest-service). Below, you can see example business use cases for KadaiHistory.
## Use Cases for KadaiHistory

    - Who worked on it before?
    - Who transferred it to me?
    - What happened in the process before it got assigned to the user?
- Auditing:

## KadaiHistory Implementation and the corresponding REST-Service

Additionaly to the SPI, KADAI already provides an implementation at io.kadai.simplehistory.impl.SimpleHistoryServiceImpl. 
You can activate SimpleHistoryServiceImpl by adding following dependency to your pom:

```
<dependency>
      <groupId>io.kadai.history</groupId>
      <artifactId>kadai-simplehistory-provider</artifactId>
      <version><put your KADAI version here></version>
</dependency>
```
KADAI also provides a REST service for SimpleHistoryServiceImpl documented [here](https://kadai.azurewebsites.net/kadai/docs/rest/simplehistory-rest-api.html). If you want to use the REST Service, you can add the following dependency to your pom:
```
<dependency>
      <groupId>io.kadai.history</groupId>
      <artifactId>kadai-simplehistory-rest-spring</artifactId>
      <version><put your KADAI version here></version>
